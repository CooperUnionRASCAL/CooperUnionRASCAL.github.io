											<h2>Mars Ascent Vehicle Design</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Mars Ascent Vehicles are critical components of manned missions to Mars,
										as they transport the astronauts from the surface of Mars to a vehicle that 
										takes them to Earth waiting in low-Mars orbit. The Cooper Union Mars Ascent 
										Vehicle is a two-person two-stage vehicle with a 3588 kg dry mass.</p>

										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-code"></span>
										<h3>Propulsion System</h3>
										<p>The MAV utilizes a unique hybrid in-situ propulsion system that eliminates the need for complex and heavy 
										cryogenic cooling systems by using paraffin fuel. An in-situ propellant production system will be used to produce 
										the oxidizer for the hybrid system in order to prevent the need for oxidizer to be carried from Earth.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-copy"></span>
										<h3>Trajectory</h3>
										<p>The proposed MAV will travel directly to a 1-Sol orbit, therefore limiting the risk involved in multiple 
										docking events and eliminating the need for an expensive taxi vehicle. The MAVâ€™s thermal protection system 
										reduces cost and weight by using a thin Advanced Flexible Reusable Surface Insulation blanket with a protective 
										ceramic coating that is adhered to the MAV.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-gem"></span>
										<h3>Reduced Weight</h3>
										<p>The Cooper Union Mars Ascent Vehicle is a two-person two-stage vehicle with a 3588 kg dry mass. Mass efficiency 
										was the focus for the project, as heavier systems lead to challenges during entry, descent, and landing. All systems 
										on the MAV, including structural, avionic, and power systems, were designed with mass savings in mind. </p>
